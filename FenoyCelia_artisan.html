                <h2> Biography</h2>

                <p> Russian Red is Lourdes Hernández, an indie, folk and pop singer from <b>Madrid</b>, Spain (<em>1985</em>). She composes and interprets all her songs in English and she affirms that she sings in that language by instinct, since she has been always listening to music in this language, emphasizing The Beatles between her main influences. She has been compared to artists such as PJ Harvey, Feist, Laura Marling, Cat Power or Dolly Parton.</p>


                <p>The name of Russian Red comes from a red shade of lipstick used by the artist herself. In her own words:

                    <em>“I had a band without a name for a long time,” she said, “since then I was pursuing an obsession: finding the ideal stage name. One day I fell in love with that color, I saw it on the lips on a girl. I loved the name, now it is my pseudonym” </em> </p>


                <p>The Russian Red project was born when Lourdes Hernández met Brian Hunt, an indie musician of English father and Spanish mother, with whom she began a romantic relationship. With Hunt, she recorded a song that received more than 70,000 visits on MySpace. Little by little she began to become well known in the Spanish indie environment, giving more than 60 concerts in 2007 and participating, among others, in the Primavera Sound Festival, a well know music festival in Spain. </p>
